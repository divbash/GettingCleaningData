##CODEBOOK

This CODEBOOK, describes the variables used in each step in the script, run_analysis.R.

##Step1. Reading the files from the folders named "train" and "test" into the following variables:

subject_train.txt into subject_train
subject_test: reading subject_test.txt 
x_train: reading X_train.txt 
x_test: reading X_test.txt 
y_train: reading y_train.txt 
y_test: reading y_test.txt
features : reading features.txt

data_x: binding rows of x_train and x_test
data_sub :binding rows of subject_train and subject_test
data_y: binding rows y_train and y_test
feat: binding the features and character "subject" and "activity:

data: the dataset after merging feat, data_x,data_y and data_sub

colnames(data): adds the 2nd row in the transpose of the feautues dataset as the variable names to the final dataset "data" after merging.

##Step2. Extracting the columns with the meana nd standard deviation measurements

m: gives the colums which contain the mean and standard deviation mesurements
dat: gives the subset of the "data" with the columns in m


##Step3. Adding a column with a meaningful name

dat:binds a new column  called "ActivityName' with default values as ActivityName

activity: is a list of activity names corresponding to the values in the column "Activity"
We run a for loop to assign, the Activity Names based on the corresponding value in the activity column.

##Step4. calculating the average 
average: calculates the average value for each column based on each Subject and each Activity

On using a the aggregate function we , two columns called "group.1" grouped by Activity & "group.2" grouped by subject

we remove the columns named "Activity " and "Subject" which existed in the original dataset  and rename the columns "group.1" as "Activity" and "group.2" as "Subject"

##Step5 Melting dataset

datm: melts/ transforms the dataset in the "average" from wide to  a long dataset in "datm"

The long form of data set hase the following columns:

"Activity" ;"Subject" ;"variable" ;"value"

We change the values in the "Activity " column to its correspong names to make the final dataset look more meaningful.
